This project presents a study conducted as part of the Big Geo-data Processing course at the ITC faculty of the University of Twente in 2022, focusing on modeling observer intensity of birds in the Netherlands using citizen science data. 

Citizen science has gained prominence in recent years, offering new opportunities for scientific research. Bird observation, a popular citizen science activity, provides spatio-temporal distribution data that can be harnessed for research. The project employs data preparation, developed and developing region division, and Random Forest modeling to predict observer intensity. Results indicate higher observer densities during weekends and the identification of potential future birdwatching areas in developing regions. Despite limitations, the study demonstrates the significance of citizen science in geo-information research and highlights the need for continuous skill development in big geodata processing.
